## Operators

#    + , - , * , / have their regular meaning

#    ** is used for exponentiation
print(3**2)   # prints 9

#    % operator  == return remainder after division

#   // operator  == floor division rounds quotient to smaller integer
print(9//4)   # 9/4 = 2.25 normal calculation ----  // returns 2
print (23//8)    # 23/8 = 2.87 normal calculation  ----  // returns 2 




## Variable Declaration

# num = 4
# x,y,z = 4,5,8

# variable  name start with letter or underscore, name cannot be same as built as in identifiers or reserved words
# try descriptive variable names
# pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate thewords (called snake_case)
new_var =78

## Assignment Operators

#  += , -= , *= , /= , %= , //= have their usual meanings

# scientific notation eg.
print(4.445e8)    # here  4.445e8 = 4.445*10**8

## Practice Question

# The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
# The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
rainfall = 5e6

# decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
rainfall*=0.9
# add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
reservoir_volume+= rainfall
# increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
# into the resevoir in the days following storm
reservoir_volume*=1.05
# decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
reservoir_volume*=0.95
# subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
# that's piped to arid regions.
reservoir_volume-=2.5e5
# print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)

# answer = 447627500.0

### Integers And Floats
 
# Declaration 
intnum =4
floatnum=4.78
# keywords ( are not used to declare/define the data type)
# int -- 387
# float --38 7. , 393.13 -- with decimal 
print ( type (387.7) )

# operation involving int and float gives float 
print( 3 + 2.5)

# convert data type to int  -- int() function
print ( int(4.78) ) # directly remove digits after decimal

# convert data type to float -- float() function
print ( float(4) )  # add .0 at end

# float approximates fractional numbers eg.
num1 =1/3
print (num1) #1/3

# this may result in diff answers when operations are performed on float numbers
print( 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1)   # gives 0.30000000000000004

# divide by zero gives ZeroDivisionError
# print (4/0)

## Best Practices In Python

# snake_case

# pythonic way to name variables is to use all lowercase letters and underscores to separate the words (called snake_case)
new_var_num = 78

# add spaces
# to lower priority operations multiple operations
# print(3*7 - 1+2)  # here space 3*7 is higher priority


## Booleans, Comparison & Logical Operators

# bool -- abbreviation for boolean value -- True/False

x = 42>48
print(x)
# > , < , >= , <=, == , != Comparison operators have their same meaning

# and , or , not Logical Operators have their same meaning

print( 4>3 and 9>5)
print ( not True )
print ( 4>7 or 8<75 )

age =14
is_teen = age>12 and age<20
print(is_teen)

not_teen = not(age>12 and age<20)


## Strings

# they are immutable ordered sequence of characters

# str keyword ( not used to declare/define string)

# single and double quotes acceptable

print("Hello")
print("hello")

welcome_message= "Hello everyone"

# define string which itself contains double quotes inside it, use the single quote eg.

pet_halibut = 'Why should I be tarred with the epithet "loony" merely because I have a pet halibut'
print(pet_halibut)

# define string which itself contains single quote inside it like in the word you're, use \'   ....eg.
salesman = ' I think you\'re an encyclopedia salesman '
print(salesman)

#or
salesman = "I think you're an encyclopedia salesman"
print(salesman)

# + sign used to combine strings
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
print(str1 + " " + str2)

# * sign used to repeat strings
str3 = "## "
print(str3 *5)

# len() function -- returns length of string
udacity_length = len("Udacity")
print(udacity_length)

# It is acceptable to index strings
first_word = "Hello"
print(first_word[0])

## STRINGS

# strings are always written in single quotes


# they are immutable ordered sequence of characters

# str keyword (not used to declare / define string)

# single and double quotes acceptable

print("Hello")
print('hello')

## TYPE &TYPE CONVERSION

# Conversion Functions
# int(number_here)
# float(number_here)
# str(number_here)

count = int(4.7)
print(count)

grams = "35.0"
grams = float(grams)
print(type(grams))

# print("0" +5)    gives error as "0" is string and 5 an integer

print(type("hippo"*12))    # gives string as "hippo"*12 repeats the string 12 times


## STRING METHODS

# methods are special types of functions but unlike functions, methods are associated with specific types of objects like strings, integer etc.

# there are different methods depending on type of data

print("sebastian thrun".title()) 

# .title() method belong to object string
# converts first letter to uppercase

full_name = "sebastian thrun"
print(full_name.islower())

# .islower() method -- belong to object string and returns True if no character in uppercase

print("one fish, two fish , red fish, blue fish".count('fish'))

# .count('sub_string_here')  -- counts number of occurences of the sub_string -- belong to object string

# print() is also a method

# .format() method

print("Mohammed has {} balloons".format(27))
# prints -- Mohammed has 27 ballons

animal = "dog"
action = "bite"
print("Does your {} {}?".format(animal,action))

# prints -- "Does your dog bite?"

book1 = "Harry Potter"
book2 = "Helen Keller"
price1 = 45
price2 = 50
print("The books and prices are as follows {}:{},{}:{} ".format(book1,price1,book2,price2))

    "book2": "Helen Keller",
    'price1': 45,
    'price2' : 50
}

print("\n The books and prices are as follows {book1},{price1},{book2}:{price2} ".format(**book_dictionary))
# **book_list is used to put list as parameter in .format() method

# .split() method

new_str = "The cow jumped over the moon" 

print( new_str.split())
# splits acc to spaces

print( new_str.split( ' ' , 3) )

# here separator is space i.e ' '
# maximum splits set to 3

print ( new_str.split(None,3) )
# None -- means no separator, thus by default,space is used as separator
